# clubrecognition

Welcome to the PL Badges Image Recognition project, a small yet exciting journey into machine learning with Python. Our goal is to teach the computer to recognize and sort out the badges of Premier League football clubs for the 2021/2022 season. Using the CRISP-DM methodology as our roadmap, we'll carefully organize our steps to ensure success in this venture. Get ready for a blend of tech magic and football fun as we make our computer super savvy at identifying the unique badges of our favorite teams. ðŸš€âš½
